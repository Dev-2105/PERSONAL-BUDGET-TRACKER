#SELF INTRO
Hi everyone, my name is Dev Kharbanda, and I'm a college student. I'm relatively new to using Excel, but I'm eager to learn and improve my skills. I'm excited to be part of this community and collaborate with others. I'm particularly interested in data visualisation & data analyis. I'm a quick learner and I'm confident that I'll be able to contribute meaningfully as I develop my expertise in Excel. Thank you for your time and consideration.
